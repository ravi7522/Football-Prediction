A bookmaker is a company or individual that sets and offers odds on various events, including sports matches like soccer games. Their goal is to balance the betting action on both sides of a bet, so they can make a profit regardless of the outcome. Bookmakers use complex algorithms and analysis to determine the odds they offer.

When you see odds like the ones mentioned above, they represent the bookmaker's estimation of the likelihood of a particular outcome occurring in a soccer match. Lower odds indicate a higher probability (according to the bookmaker) of that outcome happening, while higher odds suggest a lower probability. Betting odds also determine how much money you can win if your bet is successful. For example, if you bet $100 on a team with odds of 2.00, you would win $200 if that team wins.

The betting odds are not just about predicting the winner; they also provide insights into the perceived chances of different outcomes and the potential payouts. It's important to understand these odds before placing a bet and to gamble responsibly.
